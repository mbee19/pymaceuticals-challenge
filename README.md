Module 5 Challenge for Morgan Bee

On this assignment, I used the all the class activities from the module to complete each problem. I also used the Xpert Learning Assistant extensively to help explain various parts of the assignment and also help me when I got stuck. 

In all of the charts, I used .index to find the value for the series that I was searching for. I got this snippet of code from this Stack Overflow page: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78181349/how-to-print-rows-above-and-below-certain-value-in-column

I learned about lists and subset lists from this stack overflow page: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19252301/creating-a-new-list-with-subset-of-list-using-index-in-python

I got this line of code from the Xpert Learning Assistant to help me add specific information from one list into another list:  subset.extend(drug_rows["Tumor Volume (mm3)"].tolist())

I also learned from the Xpert Learning Assistant to place a semicolon at the end of a line of code that makes a graph/chart in order to avoid printing test and information other than the chart itself. 

In the Boxplot section, I used this code from Xpert Learning Assistant in order to correctly label the x-axis: ax1.set_xticks(range(1, len(treatments) + 1)). 

I got the color "cornflowerblue" from this site to use in my graphs: https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/color/named_colors.html
